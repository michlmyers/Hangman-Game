# Hangman-Game
WELCOME

###  What This Is
This is the Hangman game I worked on for my Rutgers Bootcamp during late March of 2018. It's my first real work using Javascript. When I first uploaded this the game was broken. I have since fixed the bugs and the game is working as expected though it isn't yet complete. This only uses vanilla JavaScript. I intend to modify the win / lose events in the future. 

### Game was updated
It now works as expected. 

### Who might enjoy
It's a useful project for me and likely any other student learning how to write Javascript. It's also fun to play for fans of horror movies or zombies. I created the music myself and there is a decent mix of words. I will likely add more in the future as well. 
Pro users can probably move on unless they are curious. Students may find some usefullness in my layout or functions.

### Questions or contact
You can contant me for any questions. I am the sole contributor to this as it's my homework.
