# Hangman-Game
WELCOME

This repo holds the Hangman game I worked on for my Rutgers Bootcamp during late March of 2018.

It's my first real work using Javascript. At the time of this README it isn't working exactly as expected so I intend to spend more time with it and get it working.

Once it works as I want I may go back and play with the style a bit more. I also wanted to leverage some sound and video but at the time of this haven't made it that far.

It's a useful project for me and likely any other student learning how to write Javascript.

Pro users can probably move on unless they are curious. Students may find some usefullness in my layout or functions.

You can contant me for any questions. I am the sole contributor to this as it's my homework.
